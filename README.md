# Budget_Regression_Python 

Similar problem statement to Budget_Linear_Regression, I started this project to exercise my Machine Learning skills in Python, as well as apply some fundamental machine learning libraries in Anaconda. 

I am developing in Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter Notebook extensions to support cell discretization of the project's machine learning life cycle stages. 

Specific cells handle data pre-processing and model training, while others manage the model's training performance statistics.
